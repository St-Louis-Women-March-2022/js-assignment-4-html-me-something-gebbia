               <h2>Farm Life in Captain Cook, Hawai‘i</h2>
               <p>The first couple of years I lived on the Big Island, I worked on various farms trading my skills and service for a place to stay, and also learned many new skills like gardening, landscaping, and making lava rock walls. 
                  One of the farms I worked on is a Kona Coffee farm where we would pick the cherries off the coffee trees, get them roasted, then we'd package them and sell the coffee at the local farmer's market.
                  We also picked, dried, packaged and sold <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipturus_albidus">māmaki</a> tea which is a species of flowering plant in the nettle family that is endemic to Hawai‘i. 
                  The Hawaiians have long used māmaki for it's medicinal benefits.</p>

               <p>The Big Island of Hawai‘i is home to 4 active volcanoes; Kīlauea, Mauna Loa, Mauna Kea, Hualālai.  <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/volcanoes/kilauea">Kīlauea Hawai‘i</a> is the youngest and most active volcano on the island of , and one of the busiest in the world. In recorded history, Kīlauea has only had short periods of repose. It has covered almost 90% of its surface in lava flows within the last 1,000 years. Some say that even the name Kīlauea translates to “spewing" or "much spreading”.</p>
                  <p>
                  First forming underwater roughly 280,000 years ago, Kīlauea is a fairly typical shield volcano with long, shallow slopes. Its surface makes up an area slightly smaller than the island of O‘ahu.</p>
                  <p>
                  Traditionally, Kīlauea is viewed by many Native Hawaiians as the home of the volcanic deity Pelehonuamea. She is said to reside in Halema‘uma‘u crater, a persistently active pit within the summit caldera. Halema‘uma‘u crater has a long history of lava lake-style eruptive events. It is currently home to a lava lake that appeared on September 29, 2021.</p>

               <p><a href="https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dsp/parks/hawaii/akaka-falls-state-park/">‘Akaka Falls State Park's</a> main attraction is the free-falling 442' tall ‘Akaka Falls along Kolekole stream. ‘Akaka means "split, separation, or crack" in the Hawaiian language. A short, paved hiking trail leads to a lookout over ‘Akaka Falls and also the smaller Kahūnā Falls.

               <h2>Pololū Valley</h2>
               <a name="valley"></a>
               <p>The word pololū means "long spear" in the Hawaiian language. The valley forms a deep cut in the side of Kohala Mountain, and is traversed in its entirety by Pololū stream. The valley is fronted on the ocean side by a beautiful black sand beach.
                  Kohala was the birthplace of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamehameha_I">King Kamehameha</a>, the leader who unified all of the islands of Hawaii in 1810 after years of conflict. He spent part of his youth protected by the residents of the Pololu Valley — one of the many reasons <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Hawaiians">Kanaka Maoli</a> consider the land sacred.
                  Prior to European colonization, <a href="https://www.lovebigisland.com/pololu-valley/">Pololū Valley</a> was renowned for its kalo (taro) farming.

                  <figcaption>My Son Kaimana and I at Keiki Ponds. Photo by Natasha Gebbia</figcaption>
                  <p>While on the Big Island, I explored, I farmed, and I learned.  Later I worked with productions and in circulations at the local News Paper company, West Hawai‘i Today. I would come to Keiki Ponds to relax near the tidepools when I had free time from working at the Newspaper. 
                     <a href="https://wehewehe.org/gsdl2.85/cgi-bin/hdict?d=D7631&l=en&e=d-11000-00---off-0hdict--00-1----0-10-0---0---0direct-10-ED--4--textpukuielbert%2Ctextmamaka-----0-1l--11-haw-Zz-1---Zz-1-home-keiki--00-4-1-00-0--4----0-0-11-00-0utfZz-8-00">Keiki</a> means "child" in the Hawaiian language, so it is fitting that this calm beach is called Keiki Ponds as it is a safer option for children. 
                     A few years after discovering Keiki Ponds near the newspaper company where I worked, I was blessed with my first child.  This is a photo of my son Kaimana and myself at Keiki Ponds. It was his first time in the ocean, which was very special as his name, Kaimana (pronounded kie-MA-na ), means "divine power of the ocean" in the Hawaiian language. My son Kaimana, by far is the best thing I grew while in Hawai‘i.
